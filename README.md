# Patching SmallTree to support I211-AT controllers

So this little project came about when Vit9696 asked to update this kext to support SmallTreeIntel82576 version `1.2.5`(And now 1.3.0), so here it is! Most users are likely running the `1.0.6` version Ydeng originally made then got rehosted both on [AMD OSX](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5Txx3pb7pgcOG5lSEF2VzFySWM/view) and on the OpenCore Guide.

**Sources**:

* Original kext: [SmallTree](https://small-tree.com/support/downloads/gigabit-ethernet-driver-download-page/)

For those having issues can use the 1.0.6 which is also availblehere: [SmallTree 1.0.6](https://github.com/khronokernel/SmallTree-I211-AT-patch/blob/master/SmallTree%201.0.6/SmallTreeIntel82576-106.kext.zip)
